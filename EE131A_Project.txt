1)  b) For this random variable, P(X=k) = (100 nCr k) (0.2)^k (0.8)^(100-k)
       From this function, we can see that the maximum value occurs at k = 21
    c) From the simulation, the max value is usually 21, but for some runs
       it can be 20. This fluctuation is due to the limited number of samples
       that we are using, but it shows that 10000 does give a fairly good
       approximation as a large N.

2)  Here are some values I got for the mean and variance from one run of
    my script:
                Expected    10      10^4    10^7
    mean        0.0000      0.5615  -0.0102 -4.110e-04
    variance    1.0000      1.3722  1.0122  0.9999

    Here are the values I got for Q from one run of my script:

            Expected    10      10^4    10^7 Samples
    Q(1)    0.1587      0.4000  0.1534  0.1586
    Q(2)    0.0228      0.1000  0.0248  0.0228
    Q(3)    0.0013      0.0000  0.0022  0.0013

    From the charts above, we can see that as the number of samples increased
    the values for mean, variance, and Q match the expected values more
    closely. This trend can also be seen in the figures with expected normal
    curve super-imposed onto the generated normal pdf. The pdf of 10 samples
    does not match curve at all, but as the number of samples increases to 10^4,
    it becomes more acceptable. Then, at 10^7 samples, the pdf almost exacly
    matches the expected curve.
