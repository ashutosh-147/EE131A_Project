1)  b) For this random variable, P(X=k) = (100 nCr k) (0.2)^k (0.8)^(100-k)
       From this function, we can see that the maximum value occurs at k = 21
    c) From the simulation, the max value is usually 21, but for some runs
       it can be 20. This fluctuation is due to the limited number of samples
       that we are using, but it shows that 10000 does give a fairly good
       approximation as a large N.
